# Diabetes-Prediction-
The Diabetes Prediction project involves analysis of data set related to diabetes and aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes based on various health factors. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of patient records, I trained a model to predict diabetes.

# Key Objectives:
1 - Gain understanding on dataset.<br>
2 - Analyze Pattern including Glucose, Blood Pressure, Insulin, Body Mass Index [BMI], Age etc. with respect to Outcome.<br>
3 - Visualize the findings for easy understanding. <br>

# Methodology:
1 - Data Cleaning <br>
2 - Descriptive Analysis <br>
3 - Exploratory Data Analysis <br>
4 - Visualizing Findings <br>
5 - Observation Writing <br>
6 - Feature Selection <br>
7 - Data Splitting <br>
8 - Hyper Parameter Tunning of Random Forest Classifier <br>
9 - Fiting Data into Random Forest Algorithm <br>
10 - Evaluation of Model <br>
11 - Hyper Parameter Tunning of Decision Tree Classifier <br>
12 - Fiting data into Decision Tree Algorithm <br>
13 - Evaluation of Model <br>
