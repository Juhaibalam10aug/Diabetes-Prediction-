# Diabetes-Prediction-
The Diabetes Prediction project involves analysis of data set related to diabetes and aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes based on various health factors. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of patient records, I trained a predictive model to predict diabetes.
